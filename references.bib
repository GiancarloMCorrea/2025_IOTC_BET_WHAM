  abstract = {Abstract             Fish stock assessment models often rely on size- or age-specific observations that are assumed to be statistically independent of each other. In reality, these observations are not raw observations, but rather they are estimates from a catch-standardization model or similar summary statistics based on observations from many fishing hauls and subsamples of the size and age composition of the data. Although aggregation mitigates the strong intra-haul correlation between sizes/ages that is usually found in haul-by-haul data, violations of the independence assumption can have a large impact on the results and specifically on reported confidence bounds. A state-space assessment model that allows for correlations between age groups within years in the observation model for catches and surveys is presented and applied to data on several North Sea fish stocks using various correlation structures. In all cases the independence assumption is rejected. Less fluctuating estimates of the fishing mortality is obtained due to a reduced process error. The improved model does not suffer from correlated residuals unlike the independent model, and the variance of forecasts is decreased.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The retrospective problem involves systematic differences in sequential population analysis (SPA) estimates of stock size or some other quantity in a reference year. The differences occur as successively more data are used for estimation, and they appear to be structural biases caused by a mis-specification of the SPA. In some cases the retrospective problem is so severe that the SPA is considered to be too unreliable for stock assessment purposes. There are many possible sources of retrospective patterns, and it is usually difficult in practice to determine which are more likely. We propose diagnostics to help determine the more likely causes. We use local influence diagnostics to investigate whether small changes or perturbations to SPA input components such as catches or natural mortalities can remove or reduce retrospective patterns. We show, for the fall-spawning herring stock in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence SPA, that relatively small age- and year-specific changes to the SPA assumptions about the proportional relationship between an abundance index and stock size can result in greatly reduced retrospective patterns. We therefore conclude primafacie that these assumptions are a plausible source of the retrospective pattern. Larger changes to catches, natural mortality assumptions, or estimation weights are required to reduce the retrospective pattern. These other factors seem to be less plausible sources of the retrospective pattern, although this is best assessed by the herring stock experts who are more knowledgeable about the fishery and other scientific information for this stock.},

  abstract = {State-space assessment models (SSMs) have garnered attention recently because of their ability to estimate time variation in biological and fisheries processes such as recruitment, natural mortality, catchability, and selectivity. However, current SSMs cannot model time-varying growth internally nor accept length data, limiting their use. Here, we expand the Woods Hole Assessment Model to incorporate new approaches to modelling changes in growth using a combination of parametric and nonparametric approaches while fitting to length and weight data. We present these new features and apply them to data for three important Alaskan stocks with distinct data and model needs. We conduct a ``selftest'' simulation experiment to ensure the unbiasedness and statistical efficiency of model estimates and predictions. This research presents the first SSM that can be applied when length data are a key source of information, variation in growth is an essential part of the dynamics of the assessed stock, or when linking climate variables to growth in hindcasts or forecasts is relevant. Consequently, the state-space approach and growth estimation can be applied to more fish stocks worldwide, facilitating real-world applications and implementation of simulation experiments for performance evaluation of SSMs for the many stocks whose assessments rely on length data.},

The user defines the joint likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects ({$\approx$} 106) and parameters ({$\approx$} 103). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org/.},

  abstract = {The population dynamics of fisheries stock enhancement, and its potential for generating benefits over and above those obtainable from optimal exploitation of wild stocks alone are poorly understood and highly controversial. I review pertinent knowledge of fish population biology, and extend the dynamic pool theory of fishing to stock enhancement by unpacking recruitment, incorporating regulation in the recruited stock, and accounting for biological differences between wild and hatchery fish. I then analyse the dynamics of stock enhancement and its potential role in fisheries management, using the candidate stock of North Sea sole as an example and considering economic as well as biological criteria. Enhancement through release of recruits or advanced juveniles is predicted to increase total yield and stock abundance, but reduce abundance of the naturally recruited stock component through compensatory responses or overfishing. Economic feasibility of enhancement is subject to strong constraints, including trade--offs between the costs of fishing and hatchery releases. Costs of hatchery fish strongly influence optimal policy, which may range from no enhancement at high cost to high levels of stocking and fishing effort at low cost. Release of genetically maladapted fish reduces the effectiveness of enhancement, and is most detrimental overall if fitness of hatchery fish is only moderately compromised. As a temporary measure for the rebuilding of depleted stocks, enhancement cannot substitute for effort limitation, and is advantageous as an auxiliary measure only if the population has been reduced to a very low proportion of its unexploited biomass. Quantitative analysis of population dynamics is central to the responsible use of stock enhancement in fisheries management, and the necessary tools are available.},

The flexibility of integrated analysis models allows them to be applied over extended time periods spanning historical decades with little information from which to estimate the annual signal of recruitment variability to modern periods in which more information about recruitment variability exists. Across this range of data availability, the estimation process must assure that the estimated log-normally distributed recruitments are mean unbiased to assure mean unbiased biomass estimates. Here we show how the estimation method implemented in the integrated analysis model, Stock Synthesis, achieves this unbiased characteristic in a penalized likelihood approach that is comparable to the results from Markov chain Monte Carlo. The total variability in recruitment is decomposed into variability among annual recruitment estimates based on information in the data and a residual variability. Because data are never perfectly informative, we show that estimated recruitment variability will always be less than the true variability among recruitments and that the method implemented here can be used to iteratively estimate the true variability among recruitments.},

The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},

The statistical aspects of formal state-space models are appealing and these models are becoming more widely used for assessments. However, treating natural mortality as known and constant across ages continues to be common practice. We developed a state-space, age-structured assessment model that allowed different assumptions for natural mortality and the degree of temporal stochasticity in abundance. We fit a suite of models where natural mortality was either age-invariant or an allometric function of mass and interannual transitions of abundance were deterministic or stochastic to observations on Gulf of Maine -- Georges Bank Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus). We found that allowing stochasticity in the interannual transition in abundance was important and estimating age-invariant natural mortality was sufficient. A simulation study showed low bias in annual biomass estimation when the estimation and simulation model matched and the Akaike imformation criterion accurately measured relative model performance, but it was important to allow simulated data sets to include the stochasticity in interannual transitions of abundance-at-age.},

  abstract = {The Woods Hole Assessment Model is a general state-space age-structured assessment model that is used to assess and manage many stocks in the Northeast US. We first describe an extension of the model allowing any number of stocks (or stock components) and regions with movement among regions as well as seasonal variation in stock and fleet dynamics. Movement rates can be functions of time- and age-varying random effects and environmental covariates. We then illustrate the model by applying it to data for the northern and southern components of the Northeast United States black sea bass stock and evaluate alternative hypotheses of bottom temperature and time-varying random effects on recruitment and natural mortality. We show strong evidence for temperature effects on recruitment, primarily for the northern stock component, and no evidence for including random effects or temperature effects on age 1 natural mortality.},

  abstract = {Temporal variation in demographic rates has been observed in various fish populations and environmental influences are likely to be a key factor. Here we show how it can be important to combine state-space models for environmental covariates and demographic rates when evaluating effects of the former on the latter. In an application to Georges Bank Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), we show how estimates of the environmental covariate can be aliased with unknown temporal variation in growth rates and that stronger and opposite effects of the environment can incorrectly be found when the autocorrelation in the growth rate is not separately modeled. The perception of effects on maturity also depends on whether an appropriate distribution is considered for the maturity observations. Bottom temperature did not improve prediction of maturity parameters, but temporal variation driven by other sources did. Both bottom temperature and temporal variation improved performance of growth models. Finally, we found growth and maturity estimation to be important contributors to uncertainty of spawning biomass and biological reference points when incorporated into a state-space assessment model.},

  abstract = {The rapid changes observed in many marine ecosystems that support fisheries pose a challenge to stock assessment and management predicated on time-invariant productivity and considering species in isolation. In single-species assessments, two main approaches have been used to account for productivity changes: allowing biological parameters to vary stochastically over time (empirical), or explicitly linking population processes such as recruitment (R) or natural mortality (M) to environmental covariates (mechanistic). Here, we describe the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM) framework and software package, which combines these two ap\- proaches. WHAM can estimate time- and age-varying random effects on annual transitions in numbers at age (NAA), M, and selectivity, as well as fit environmental time-series with process and observation errors, missing data, and nonlinear links to R and M. WHAM can also be configured as a traditional statistical catch-at-age (SCAA) model in order to easily bridge from status quo models and test them against models with state-space and environmental effects, all within a single framework.},

  abstract = {Biological processes such as fishery selectivity, natural mortality, and somatic growth can vary over time, but it is challenging to estimate the magnitude of time-variation of demographic parameters in population dynamics models, particularly when using penalizedlikelihood estimation approaches. Random-effect approaches can estimate the variance, but are computationally infeasible or not implemented for many models and software packages. We show that existing models and software based on penalized-likelihood can be used to calculate the Laplace approximation to the marginal likelihood of parameters representing variability over time, and specifically demonstrate this approach via application to Stock Synthesis. Using North Sea cod and Pacific hake models as case studies, we show that this method has little bias in estimating variances for simulated data. It also provides a similar estimate of variability in hake recruitment (log-SD {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.43) to that obtained from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (log-SD {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.68), and the method estimates a non-trivial magnitude (log-SD {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.07) of variation in growth for North Sea cod. We conclude by discussing the generality of the proposed method and by recommending future research regarding its performance relative to MCMC, particularly when estimating multiple variances simultaneously.},
